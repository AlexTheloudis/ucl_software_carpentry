# Software Carpentry

* Helps researchers be more productive by teaching them basic computing skills:
    * program construction
    * version control
    * testing
    * the command line
    * data management
* Volunteer organization supported by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation and the Mozilla Foundation.
* Provides online training materials and run boots camps like this one.

# Why is Software Carpentry needed?

* Scientists increasingly use computers for their work, but often they do not do so effectively:
    * not familiar with software development techniques
    * carry out repetitive tasks by hand
* Traditionally programming courses for scientists
    * focus on language syntax rather than general principles
    * assume you will learn not to make mistakes
* Current climate favours
    * big data
    * parallel computing for speed
    * ...but *correctness* is overlooked, or taken for granted
* Software Carpentry aims to fill in the gaps
    * learn lessons from software engineering practice, and empirical studies
    * start with most important practical steps: software *carpentry*

# Best Practices for Scientific Computing

* Greg Wilson and 12 others: http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0530
* Ten rules to support *correct*, *reproducible* results:
    * Write programs for people, not computers
    * Automate repetitive tasks
    * Use the computer to record history
    * Make incremental changes
    * Use version control
    * Donâ€™t repeat yourself (or others)
    * Plan for mistakes
    * Optimize software only after it works correctly
    * Document design and purpose, not mechanics
    * Collaborate

# Schedule
