# # Exercise 1
# 
# 1. Calculate the mean of the numbers 2, 3, and 10 (using methods available in list to sum and count number of elements).

# <codecell>

  

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercise 2
# 
# 1. Make a list with 5 things in it.

# <codecell>

  

# <markdowncell>

# 2. Add two more things.

# <codecell>

   

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercise 2
# 
# 1. Make a dictionary whose keys are the strings "zero" through "nine" and whose values are ints 0 through 9.

# <codecell>

digitsdict = {}

#  Your code goes here

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercise 3
# 
# 1. Make a dictionary and experiment using different types as keys. Can containers be keys?

# <codecell>

  

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercises 4
# 
# 1. Write an if statement that prints whether x is even or odd

# <codecell>

x=4

print x

if x < 5:

  print "x is less than five!"

else: 

  print "x is not less than five!"

# # Exercises 5
# 
# 1. Using a loop, calculate the factorial of 42 (the product of all integers up to and including 42).

# <codecell>

   

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercises 6
# 
# 1. Create a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

# <codecell>

 

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercise 7
# 
# 7A. Read the file 'animals.txt' and print each line and the length of each line.

# <codecell>


# <markdowncell>

#  7B. Read the file 'big_animals.txt' again and print each line where the number of animals sighted is greater than 10.  We won't output the lines with fewer than 10 animals.

# <codecell>


# <markdowncell>

# 7C. Read the file 'big_animals.txt' again and return a list of tuples (one per line) with animal name and number of sights.

# <codecell>


# <markdowncell>

# 7D. Turn the code for 7C into a function and use it on the files 'merida_animals.txt' and 'fergus_animals.txt'. (Optional, you will learn how to define your own functions in Lesson 4)

# <codecell>

 

# <markdowncell>

# # Exercise 8
# 
# 1.  Check your answer to Exercise 5 (the value of 42!) using the **math.gamma()** function.

# <codecell>

import math
