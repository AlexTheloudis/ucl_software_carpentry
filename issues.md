# Some issues identified during the day

## Internet
* Eduroam not set up on some laptops
* Eduroam connectivity flaky - this is due to the lack of DHCP leases available. Solutions - use alternative temporary internet solution, turn off other devices (e.g. phones) that use wifi.

## Coordination
* Not clear where people to go to at beginning - signs for tables?
* Tension between grouping individuals by departmental teams versus by platform

## Software versions, conflicts and installation problems
* iPython notebook on Windows
* different versions of iPython notebook on Mac and Windows - Windows using Anaconda, while Mac users are using Enthought
* bombarding Windows users with use of a text editor such as vim is a bit nasty.  We could include link to Wordpad or TextPad in the setup script.

## Facilities 
* many power sockets in G20 were not working (fuse blown?)
* power sockets in G20 are not physically suitable for block mac power adapters (need a power plug on cord)
