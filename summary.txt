# Summary points from the UCL Software Carpentry Workshop (April 2013)

# Good stuff
Interactive
Liked SQL
Got lots of experience in development
Missed the first morning but could still follow
Python tutorial was great
Got all the basics that I needed to carry out my own work
Demonstrators were very helpful
Diversity of topics was great
Interactivity and level of complexity was good
Really liked the notes & use of notebook: can go back to material afterwards
Well pitched and not patronising
Liked the flow of ideas and topics
Number of demonstrators was excellent
Unit testing was really useful
Software supported on all platforms

# Suggested improvements for next time
Some people struggled with SQL
Coffee next time please!
Would have liked notes etc in advance
Version control went a little too quickly
Could make better use of people's offline time
Would like to have got to joins faster in SQL
Sometimes hard to see how techniques are applicable to work
More big picture would be useful
Couldn't open all of the files easily during the workshop (Windows user)
Would have preferred half days rather than whole days
Sometimes moved too fast
Could have done with a break in the afternoon
